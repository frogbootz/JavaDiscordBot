Discord bot made in Java with use of the JDA Discord wrapper that can be found <a href="https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA">Here</a>

Very simple discord bot with two working commands that detect user input and outputs a video to the same channel they typed the phrase into.

This could be used as a good base to get you started.
